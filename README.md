Pi Plate Clip
=============

An accessory for the [Adafruit's Prototyping Pi Plate](http://www.adafruit.com/products/801)
for the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

These are plastic clips that can be used to add additional support, so when you push
wires into the board, it does not bend and damage the Pi connection pins.

Designed to be cut out of acryllic using a laser cutter.
